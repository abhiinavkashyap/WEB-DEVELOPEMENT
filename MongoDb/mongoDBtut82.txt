7.PROJECTION
Selecting only the necessary data rather than selecting whole of the data of a document.Suppose a document has
5 fields and you need to show only 3,then select only 3 from them.
Following are the ways you can do so -:
a)db.items.find({rating:{$lt:4.9}}, {rating:1})
  This means only rating field will be displayed whose rating is less than 4.9
  Here rating:1 means only rating field will be true rest of the fields will be false
b)db.items.find({rating:{$lt:4.9}}, {rating:0})
  This means all the fields will be displayed except rating whose rating is less than 4.9
  here rating:0 means only rating field will be false rest of the field will be true
c)db.items.find({rating:{$lt:4.9}}, {rating:1,qty:1})
  This means only "rating" and "qty" field will be displayed whose rating is less than 4.9
